This is my first game I'm sharing to the public, sadly I don't know how to add any music to the game or make the program an executable yet but, I am always learning new things. 

All images in the game I made in photoshop but, anyone can use them if they really want to (Just credit me first please!!!).

I hope you enjoy the game!!!
